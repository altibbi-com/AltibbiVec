## AraVec 1.0

## How To Use
These models were built using [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) Python library. Here's a simple code for loading and using
one of the models by following these steps:
1. Install `gensim` >= **3.4** and `nltk` >= **3.2** using either `pip` or `conda`

>> pip install gensim nltk

>> conda install gensim nltk

2. extract the compressed model files to a directory [ e.g. `Altibbi-FastText` ]
3. keep the **.npy** files. You are gonna to load the file with no extension, like what you'll see in the following code.
4. run this python code to load and use the model
